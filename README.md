# Fractional Indexing

This is based on [Implementing Fractional Indexing
](https://observablehq.com/@dgreensp/implementing-fractional-indexing) by [David Greenspan
](https://github.com/dgreensp).

Fractional indexing is a technique to create an ordering that can be used for [Realtime Editing of Ordered Sequences](https://www.figma.com/blog/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences/).

This should be byte-for-byte compatible with https://github.com/roci.dev/fractional-indexing.
